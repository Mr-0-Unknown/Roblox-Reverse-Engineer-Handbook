### Roblox Client Anti-Cheat Flags (HATE Flags - Circa 2016)

**Introduction:**
This document outlines the various client-side detection flags, colloquially known as "HATE Flags," reportedly used in the Roblox client circa 2016. These flags represent specific integrity violations or suspicious activities detected by the client's anti-cheat systems. When a flag was triggered, it would typically be aggregated into a bitmask (likely within a structure related to `sendStats` or a similar telemetry packet) and reported to the server, often via the Fuzzy Security Token system. The server could then interpret these flags to decide on appropriate actions.

This information is derived from historical analysis and does not reflect Roblox's current, more advanced anti-cheat solutions.

| Flag Name                                | Bit | Description & Implication (from code & context)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Probable Related Mechanism(s)                                  |
| :--------------------------------------- | :-- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HATE_IMPOSSIBLE_ERROR`                  | 31  | **Severe Internal Inconsistency:** An assertion or sanity check failed, indicating an internal error state that should logically never occur. This could imply deep-level memory corruption or manipulation of the anti-cheat's own state.                                          | Internal State / Sanity Checks                                 |
| `HATE_CE_ASM`                            | 30  | **WriteCopy Violation / Assembly Change:** Detected modification of executable memory regions (e.g., `.text` section) or a copy-on-write event triggered on such a page. Likely tied to the `writecopyTrap` mechanism designed to catch unauthorized writes to code.                | Memory Check (PMC / `writecopyTrap`)                           |
| `HATE_NEW_AV_CHECK`                      | 29  | **Stealth Edit Activity:** Detected memory page permission manipulations consistent with the "Stealthedit" technique (e.g., making code pages writable, patching, then restoring permissions).                                                                                      | Memory Check (PMC - `areMemoryPagePermissionsSetupForHacking`) |
| `HATE_HASH_FUNCTION_CHANGED`             | 28  | **Anti-Cheat Hashing Code Modified:** An integrity check (likely a hash) on the anti-cheat's own memory hashing functions (e.g., XXHash implementation or PMC's core hashing loop) failed, indicating tampering with the checker itself.                                            | Memory Check (PMC Integrity)                                   |
| `HATE_RETURN_CHECK`                      | 27  | **Function Return Address Tampered:** A RetCheck validation failed, indicating that a function's return address on the call stack was modified, likely to hijack execution flow (e.g., ROP attack, shellcode).                                                                      | Return Check (RetCheck)                                        |
| `HATE_VERB_SNATCH`                       | 26  | **Suspicious Build/Debug Artifact Access:** Detected attempts to access or interact with files, strings, or handles typically associated with Roblox internal build tools, debug symbols (PDBs), or development resources.                                                          | Signature Check / Heuristics                                   |
| `HATE_VEH_HOOK`                          | 25  | **Vectored Exception Handler (VEH) Misuse:** Detected the registration of an unauthorized VEH handler or modification of the VEH chain. Cheats use VEH for stealthy hooking, anti-debugging, or bypassing other checks.                                                             | Environment Check / Hooking Detection                          |
| `HATE_HSCE_HASH_CHANGED`                 | 24  | **`HumanoidState::computeEvent` Modified:** A specific hash integrity check on the machine code of the critical `HumanoidState::computeEvent` function failed, indicating this core character state logic was tampered with.                                                        | Memory Check (PMC - Specific Func)                             |
| `HATE_DLL_INJECTION`                     | 23  | **Unauthorized DLL Loaded:** Generic detection of a dynamically linked library being loaded into the Roblox process that is not on an allowlist or matches known cheat DLL signatures.                                                                                              | Environment Check / Signature Check                            |
| `HATE_INVALID_ENVIRONMENT`               | 22  | **Disallowed Environment (VM/Sandbox):** Detected that the client is running inside a known virtual machine (VM), emulator, or sandboxing environment (e.g., Sandboxie) often used to analyze or isolate cheats.                                                                    | Environment Check / Signature Check                            |
| `HATE_SPEEDHACK`                         | 21  | **Game Speed Manipulation Detected:** Identified tools, memory modifications, or API abuse (e.g., `timeBeginPeriod`, `QueryPerformanceCounter` hooks) aimed at altering the perception or reality of game time.                                                                     | Signature Check / Heuristics / API Hooking                     |
| `HATE_LUA_VM_HOOKED`                     | 20  | **Lua Virtual Machine Tampered:** Detected hooking or modification of the Lua interpreter's internal functions (e.g., C call boundaries like `f_Ccall`, GC mechanisms) or critical VM data structures.                                                                              | Lua Environment Hardening / Hooking                            |

Indicates platform-specific memory scanning detected tampering.                                                                                                      | Memory Check (PMC - macOS specific)                            |
| `HATE_UNHOOKED_VEH`                      | 18  | **Roblox's VEH Handler Removed/Bypassed:** Indicates an exploit likely tampered with the VEH chain to remove or disable Roblox's own critical exception handlers (used for crash reporting, anti-debug, etc.).                                                                      | Environment Check / Hooking Detection                          |
| `HATE_CHEATENGINE_NEW`                   | 17  | **Newer Cheat Engine Techniques Detected:** A signature or heuristic associated with newer, unspecified, or evolving Cheat Engine methods was found.                                                                                                                                | Signature Check                                                |

Indicates very targeted tampering. | Memory Check (PMC - Specific Func/State)                       |
| `HATE_WEAK_DM_POINTER_BROKEN`            | 15  | **DataModel Weak Pointer Anomaly:** Likely detected an issue with weak pointers in the DataModel, such as a pointer becoming null prematurely or unexpectedly, potentially indicating a use-after-free attempt or object lifetime manipulation.                                     | Heuristics / Internal State Check                              |
| `HATE_LUA_HASH_CHANGED`                  | 14  | **Lua Core Integrity Failure:** A hash integrity check on the Lua VM's core executable code or its fundamental data structures (not scripts themselves) failed.                                                                                                                     | Memory Check (PMC) / Lua Hardening                             |
| `HATE_DESTROY_ALL`                       | 13  | **Anomalous Mass Object Destruction/Call:** Potentially detected a "nuker" type exploit attempting to destroy many game objects simultaneously, or an unusual pattern of critical function calls. Could also be a placeholder for a specific named exploit.                         | Heuristics / Control Flow Anomaly                              |
