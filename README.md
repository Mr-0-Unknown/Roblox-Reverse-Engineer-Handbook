# Roblox Reverse Engineer Handbook

A comprehensive resource for understanding historical Roblox client security mechanisms and anti-cheat systems through reverse engineering analysis.

## Overview

This handbook documents the technical aspects of Roblox's client-side security implementations, focusing on historical (circa 2016) anti-cheat systems, detection mechanisms, and security research findings. The content is based on reverse engineering analysis and is intended to provide educational insights into game security architecture.

The information presented here is derived from:
- Reverse engineering of Roblox client binaries
- Analysis of network traffic and client-server interactions
- Examination of source code and public documentation
- Historical discussions and community knowledge

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Historical Context**: The security mechanisms documented here reflect systems from circa 2016 and do not represent Roblox's current, significantly more advanced security infrastructure.

## Contents

- **[HATE Flags Documentation](hate-flags.md)** - Detailed analysis of Roblox's client-side anti-cheat detection flags
- **[General Security Mechanisms](security-mechanisms.md)** - Overview of client-side security features and their purposes
